AKA: Project LET HIM COOOOOK!

A 100% HTML-based project consisting of various recipies that make my tongue buds tingle~

#1 NOTE TO SELF: (regarding git commands to update/transfer repos with edits to github)
1. git add example
2. git commit -m example
3. git push origin main

#2 NOTE TO SELF: (regarding relations between anchor tags & text vs. headings)
Discovery: In this project, an anchor tag was followed by a image tag. When adding text
in between the opening and closing anchor tag, the text would be linked but placed in between
the side of the page and push the image to the right. A "br" tag in between the anchor and 
image tag is required to keep the text linked as is and place it atop the image itself.
However, wrapping the text with heading tags works as well. 

#3 NOTE TO SELF: (regarding git commit -m)
Reminder: After typing git commit -m, type the first quote ", and then your message, you're able to hit shift & return two move down two lines and type the last quote when you're done. If you type the first and last quote on the first line, hitting return will assume you're done. In other words, typing in the last quote causes for the return to be detected as an enter key. Type the last quote when you've completed the commit message.
