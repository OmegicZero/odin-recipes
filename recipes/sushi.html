            <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Some people might shrink at the thought of eating raw sushi, but sushi lovers out would salivate. Imagine a samurai without a sword. Now imagine a sushi lover without the ability to make homemade sushi. You've imagined the same thing twice. The enjoyment of sushi at home equates to grandma doing 60mph on a 30mph speed limit.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 1/3 cups water</li>
                    <li>2/3 cup uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons wihte sugar</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
                    <li>sheets nori seaweed sheets</li>
                    <li>1/2 pound imitation crabmeat, flaked</li>
                    <li>1 avocado-peeled, pitted, and sliced</li>
                    <li>1/2 cucumber, peeled, cut into small strips</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons pickled ginger</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into cooked rice in the pot and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet.</li>
                    <li>Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1 to 2 minutes</li>
                    <li>Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a thin layer of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the center. Lift one end of the mat and roll it tightly over filling to make a complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each rool into 4 to 6 slices.</li>
                </ol>
